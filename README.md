# Hate Speech Classification 

This project is a simple web application that detects hate speech in user-inputted text. It is built using **Flask** for the backend, **HTML/CSS** for the frontend, and a **Linear Regression** machine learning model for classification.

---

## 🚀 Features

- 🧠 ML-powered hate speech detection  
- 🌐 Simple and intuitive web interface  
- ⚡ Fast predictions with lightweight backend  
- 🧪 Easy to test with custom input

## 📒 Running the Jupyter Notebook

### 1. Launch Jupyter Notebook

```bash
jupyter notebook

```
### 2. Open the file
In the Jupyter interface that opens in your browser, navigate to:
```bash
hate_speech.ipynb
```
### 3. Import the dataset
Ensure the file labeled_data.csv is present in the root directory. It contains the labeled text data used for training the model. The notebook reads this file using:
```python
import pandas as pd
df = pd.read_csv('labeled_data.csv')

```

### 4. Run all cells
Click Kernel → Restart & Run All to execute the full notebook and view training steps, evaluation, and model export (model.pkl, vectorizer.pkl).
-Load and explore the dataset

- Train the Linear Regression model 
- Evaluate the model  
- Save the trained model to model.pkl 
- Save the vectorizer to vectorizer.pkl
